    <h2>ABOUT W3C</h2>
    <section id="about">
        The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is the main international standards organization for the World Wide Web. 
        Founded in 1994 and led by Tim Berners-Lee, the consortium is made up of member organizations that maintain full-time staff working 
        together in the development of standards for the World Wide Web. As of 5 March 2023, W3C had 462 members.[3][2] W3C also engages in education and outreach, 
        develops software and serves as an open forum for discussion about the Web.

    <h2>HISTORY OF W3C</h2>
    <section id="history">The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was founded in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee after he left the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in October 1994.[4] It was founded at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Laboratory for Computer Science with support from the European Commission, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which had pioneered the ARPANET, one of the predecessors to the Internet.[3] It was located in Technology Square until 2004, when it moved, with the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, to the Stata Center.[5]

        The organization tries to foster compatibility and agreement among industry members in the adoption of new standards defined by the W3C. Incompatible versions of HTML are offered by different vendors, causing inconsistency in how web pages are displayed. The consortium tries to get all those vendors to implement a set of core principles and components that are chosen by the consortium.
        
        It was originally intended that CERN host the European branch of W3C; however, CERN wished to focus on particle physics, not information technology. In April 1995, the French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation became the European host of W3C, with Keio University Research Institute at SFC becoming the Asian host in September 1996.[6] Starting in 1997, W3C created regional offices around the world. As of September 2009, it had eighteen World Offices covering Australia, the Benelux countries (Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg), Brazil, China, Finland, Germany, Austria, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Israel, Italy, South Korea, Morocco, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, and, as of 2016, the United Kingdom and Ireland.[7]
        
        In October 2012, W3C convened a community of major web players and publishers to establish a MediaWiki wiki that seeks to document open web standards called the WebPlatform and WebPlatform Docs.
        
        In January 2013, Beihang University became the Chinese host.[8]
        
        In 2022 the W3C WebFonts Working Group won an Emmy Award from the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences for standardizing font technology for custom downloadable fonts and typography for web and TV devices.[9]

    <h2>ADMINISTRATION</h2>
    <section id="admin">
        In January 2023, after 28 years of being jointly administered by the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (located in Stata Center) in the United States, the European Research Consortium for Informatics and Mathematics [fr][14] (in Sophia Antipolis, France), Keio University (in Japan) and Beihang University (in China), the W3C incorporated as a legal entity, becoming a public-interest not-for-profit organization.[15]

        The W3C has a staff team of 70â€“80 worldwide as of 2015.[16] W3C is run by a management team which allocates resources and designs strategy, led by CEO Jeffrey Jaffe[17] (as of March 2010), former CTO of Novell. It also includes an advisory board that supports strategy and legal matters and helps resolve conflicts.[18][19] The majority of standardization work is done by external experts in the W3C's various working groups.[20]

    <h2>MEMBERSHIP</h2>
    <section id="membership">
        The Consortium is governed by its membership. The list of members is available to the public.[2] Members include businesses, nonprofit organizations, universities, governmental entities, and individuals.[21]

        Membership requirements are transparent except for one requirement: An application for membership must be reviewed and approved by the W3C. Many guidelines and requirements are stated in detail, but there is no final guideline about the process or standards by which membership might be finally approved or denied.[22]

        The cost of membership is given on a sliding scale, depending on the character of the organization applying and the country in which it is located.[23] Countries are categorized by the World Bank's most recent grouping by gross national income per capita.[24]
    </section>
    <h2>CRITICISM</h2>
    <section id="critics">
        In 2012 and 2013, the W3C started considering adding DRM-specific Encrypted Media Extensions (EME) to HTML5, which was criticised as being against the openness, interoperability, and vendor neutrality that distinguished websites built using only W3C standards from those requiring proprietary plug-ins like Flash.[25][26][27][28][29] On 18 September 2017, the W3C published the EME specification as a recommendation, leading to the Electronic Frontier Foundation's resignation from W3C.[30][31] As feared by the opponents of EME, as of 2020, none of the widely used Content Decryption Modules used with EME is available for licensing without a per-browser licensing fee.[32][33]
